# G-Research Data Engineering Challenge

Over the next few days, we want you to conduct an *exploratory data analysis* of a problem of your choosing. Don't worry if you have not done anything like this before - we're here to help!

## What will I be doing?
Over the 2 1/2 day challenge, you'll learn how to analyse and interpret data. You will:
1. Pick an important problem that you would like to help solve. Think big: climate change, pandemics, inequality - the world is your oyster.  
2. Find interesting datasets on that problem available online.
3. Visualise and analyse the data with our help: What does it tell us about the problem? What else do we need to know? 
4. Bring everything you've worked on together into a presentation that will really wow your audience.

Now lets break things down, day by day.

**Day 1**

The first day is for you to settle in and get started. 
- We'll start the day with a hands on data analysis workshop. We'll go through an exercise together where you will download, process, and analyse a dataset with our help.
- After lunch, you'll pair up and decide on a problem that you want to study. 

**Day 2**

The second day will be for you to really get into your project. We'll be around throughout the day to help you with any problems you encounter, but for the most part it'll be over to you to really work on understanding your dataset and finding out interesting problems.

**Day 3**

The big day. Time to show of all that you have learnt and really impress. We'll start the morning off with a quick presentation workshop. Then you'll have some time to put together and practice a presentation of your own. Finally, we'll head out to main concourse where you will present your work to the other participants (and some select senior members of staff!).

This might all sound a bit intimidating, but its important to stress that *we don't expect perfection*. All we want to see is that you are engaging with the problem, that you are learning and that you are having a good time! And of course, there will always be a few of us around to help in case you get stuck.

## What kind of problems could I study?
TODO: Finish this section.

Whatever inspires you! But remember, you've only got a short amount of time to work on it. The ideal problem will be:
- Important. You should be able to say why you think this problem is worth your time.
- Quantifiable.
- Well studied. You'll need lots of data for your problem

Here's some ideas to get you started. You can work on these problems if you'd like, or use these as inspiration for your own ideas.
